testing 
Oh git! You make me feel insane!
You speak in riddles and are a pain.



You make each class into a slog,
and leave me after in a fog.

Yet still I'll try to get the gist,
With my head held high and my hand in fist
and leave me beaten like a blue cat.

Yet still I'll try to get the gist,
With my head held high and my hand in fist
and leave after in a fog.

Yet still I'll try to get the gist,
With my head held high and my hand in fist..

It is not in vain to fork in twain

a project lain before you
